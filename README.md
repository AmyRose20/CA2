My first attempt at a small rpg world. Floor or tiles of world are created using a a text file containing the dimensions
of the world along with IDs of different tiles, represented by 0s and 1s. To move the player around, the keys W, A, S and D are used. When
the player comes into close conntact with a static object (tree or flower) and their coordinates intersect (collion detection), the player can pick up the object by pressing the arrow keys in raltion to where the collision is occuring. E.g. If the player was to the left of an object, they would press the right key. If the player was to the right of the object, they would press the left key (i.e. in the direction that the player and object are intersecting).
